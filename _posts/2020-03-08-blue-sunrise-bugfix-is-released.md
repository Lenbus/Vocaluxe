![Release of Vocaluxe (Blue Sunrise)]({{site.baseurl}}/img/posts/release-0.4.png){:.post-banner}

Today we released Vocaluxe 0.4.1, which brings some bugfixes to Vocaluxe 0.4.0, released 2017.

<!--more-->

### What's new in this version?
Some changes to the PortAudio backend, which prevented starting Vocaluxe on some Windows systems. Also some more smaller bugs was fixed.

### What will happens next?
Development of new features just started: There will be a new theme, a rating bar and maybe more - Just try out nightly builds, follow our development on GitHub or give us a 'like' on facebook. Another thing might be proper linux support, if someone could help us: We would appreciate this. Our plan is to release new versions more often and more continously, but time is expensive and we will we see what the future brings...

And now: Grab your mics, start singing and have fun with our newest Vocaluxe. You can find all downloads [here]({{site.baseurl}}/#download).
